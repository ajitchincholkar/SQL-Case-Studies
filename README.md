# SQL-Case-Studies
This repository serves as the solution for the case studies from the #8WeekSQLChallenge.

 They are interesting real-world case studies that will allow you to apply and enhance your SQL skills in many use cases.

 I used PostgreSQL in writing SQL queries to solve these case studies.
